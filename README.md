These are the Java backend files written in IntelliJ and the React, CSS, and HTML frontend files created in Visual Studio Code for a movie website where you can leave reviews, watch movie trailers, scroll through the movie list, and enjoy the visual design of the site. The backend is built in Java and uses RESTful APIs to manage movie data and user interactions. The API allows for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving movies, as well as posting and displaying reviews for each movie. It also includes functionality for fetching movie trailers from external sources, providing users with an interactive and engaging experience.

The site features an intuitive and responsive user interface developed with React, HTML, and CSS, offering users an easy way to explore and engage with movie content. The MongoDB database stores movie information, user reviews, and other related data, while the ngrok utility link provides a real-time, publicly accessible endpoint for testing and interacting with the app.

With this web app, users can interact with an API to access information about movies, view trailers, and leave reviews. The combination of Java for the backend, React for the frontend, and MongoDB for data storage ensures that the app is both powerful and scalable, ready to handle a growing movie catalog and user interactions. The app is designed to provide a smooth and engaging user experience, while the API serves as the backbone for movie management and user interaction.

I haven't deployed it yet, but I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. Enjoy!
